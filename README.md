# hello-world

I'm Kristina üë©, noob.\
\
With MATLAB and C++ I've been solving numerically model analysis physics problems:\
[Modelska analiza I (Model analysis I)](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/en/study-physics/programmes/2jet/2020/courses/1022/)\
[Modelska analiza II (Model analysis II)](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/en/study-physics/programmes/2jet/2020/courses/1023/)\
[Raƒçunalni≈°ka dinamika tekoƒçin (CFD)](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/en/study-physics/programmes/2jet/2020/courses/1647/)\
[Fizika in tehnika fuzijskih reaktorjev (Physics and technology of fusion reactors)](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/en/study-physics/programmes/2jet/2021/courses/1016/)\
[Fizika fisijskih reaktorjev (Physics of fission reactors)](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/en/study-physics/programmes/2jet/2021/courses/1015/)\
\
My MSc Thesis simulations (Nuclear Thermal Hydraulics) - I got final results in August, 2020 ‚û°Ô∏è CFD : ANSYS CFX + MATLAB.\
\
A conference paper done with my mentor, presenting a part of my MSc Thesis work I did at the Reactor Engineering Divison R4, Jo≈æef Stefan Institute, Slovenia:\
[*"Downward Scaling of Experiment on Containment Atmosphere Mixing"*](https://arhiv.djs.si/proc/nene2020/pdf/NENE2020_1805.pdf)\
\
1 year of experience in HPC.\
\
I'm quite comfy writing in üíô LaTeX üíô (TeXstudio).\
